# `bevy_tween`

An ECS-based [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) procedural and asset animation library.

This is a young plugin and APIs are to be fleshed out.
Breaking changes are to be expected!

See changelog [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Features
- **Ergonomic and user-friendly API**: API are designed to be concise, expressive, and simple to use.
  Animation can be built using the combinator framework.
  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```rust
  let sprite_id = commands.spawn(SpriteBundle { ... }).id();
  let sprite = sprite_id.into_target();
  commands.animation()
      .insert(tween(
          Duration::from_secs(1),
          EaseFunction::Linear,
          sprite.with(translation(pos0, pos1))
      ));
  ```

  You can also abstract animation!
  ```rust
  fn my_animation(
      target: TargetComponent,
      duration: Duration
  ) -> impl FnOnce(&mut AnimationCommands, &mut Duration) {
      parallel((
          tween(duration, EaseFunction::QuadraticOut, target.with(translation(...))),
          tween(duration, EaseFunction::QuadraticOut, target.with(rotation(...))),
      ))
  }

  let sprite_id = commands.spawn(Sprite { ... }).id();
  let sprite = sprite_id.into_target();
  commands.animation().insert(my_animation(sprite, Duration::from_secs(1)))
  ```

  </details>
- **Flexible and Extensible**: Everything is components and systems with a sprinkle of dependency injection.
  - Tween anything from anywhere, built-in or custom system.
  - Interpolate with any curve, built-in or custom system.
  - *Literally anything* as long as they're time controlled.

- **Parallelism**: Since a tween or an animation primitive is one component and one system,
  they have great chances for system parallelism and increase in performance.
- **Rich timer control**:
  - Looping
  - Fastforward or Rewind
  - Skip backward or forward
  - Jumping to anywhen

See [demos](#Demos)

Goals:
- [x] Flexible ðŸŽ‰
- integration with other crates (?)
  - [ ] `bevy_animation`
  - [x] `bevy_lookup_curve`
- [ ] Editor. While the original goal for this crate is tweening from code,
       this crate absolutely has the capability to work on any complex animations.
       The editor will aid in such jobs.
  - Real-time display at any point in time in the animation.
  - Editing path from point A to point B with arbitary curve.

## Differences
The main motivation for this tweening crate is that the previous
existing tweening crates is not flexible enough and so the main goal is to solve it.

Differences to [`bevy_tweening`](https://github.com/djeedai/bevy_tweening)
or [`bevy_easings`](https://github.com/vleue/bevy_easings):
- Tweening is not tied to a certain entity. You can create an entity specifically
  for tweening any where in the world.
- Complex animations, such as sequential or parallel tweening, are solved using
  child-parent hierarchy:
  - Solved the issue of modifying animation at runtime presents in the previous
    crates.
  - Everything exists in the ECS world with no hidden structure, everything can
    be freely accessed.
  - Makes a very extendable system, thanks Bevy's ECS!
  - It's possible to have multiple `Interpolator` (or `Lens` if you came from `bevy_tweening`)
    tweening the same component/asset/resource because of the design of this crate and
    so it is not limited by '1 component type per entitiy'.
- Advanced timer. This crate has custom timer implementation.
- Dependency injection. Systems communicate through various specific components,
  allowing you to extends the behavior to your needs by supplying those components
  and reduce duplication.
- Users of this crate are free to decide if they want to only use generic,
  only trait object, or even both for tweening, or even something else entirely.

## Feature gates
- Defaults
  - `bevy_asset`<br/>
     Add tweening systems for asset.
  - `bevy_render`<br/>
    Currently add nothing but required by the `bevy_sprite` feature.
  - `bevy_sprite`<br/>
    Add some built-in interpolators related to sprite.
  - `bevy_ui`<br/>
    Add some built-in interpolators related to ui.
  - `bevy_eventlistener`<br/>
    Add entity-targeted events with bevy_eventlistener.
- Optional
  - `bevy_lookup_curve`.<br/>
    Adds interpolation implementation using [`bevy_lookup_curve`](https://github.com/villor/bevy_lookup_curve).

## Credits
- [`bevy_tweening`](https://github.com/djeedai/bevy_tweening)

  The first crate I discovered and tried to do tweening with in Bevy.
  Their method of `Lens` is great and so it's present in this crate.
  Now called `Interpolator`. Usages may be similar but is
  implemented differently.

- [`godot`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

  Godot's tween make it simple to animate something which is the
  inspiration for this crate. The multi-entity architecture is mainly inspired by
  Godot's node child-parent hierarchy system and that most of the engine APIs
  utilizes this to define behavior.
